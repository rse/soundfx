About
-----

This is a small audio collection and associated tiny JavaScript library
(for use in the Browser in combination with a player library like
[Howler](https://howlerjs.com/)) to play particular sound effects in a
HTML5 Single-Page-Application (SPA).

All sounds were hand-selected from free audio resources and were
licensed by their authors under either the permissive [Creative
Commons 0 (CC-0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)
or the [Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported
(CC-BY-3.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) distribution
licenses. Check the [soundfx.d/*.txt](./soundfx.d/) files for the
particular origin and license information details for each audio file.
To easily give proper credit and to comply with the licenses SoundFX
provides an assembled form of all origin and license information via its
API.

For convenience reasons SoundFX provides both individual audio files
`soundfx.d/*.mp3` and an "all-in-one" audio sprite `soundfx.data-sprite.mp3`.
Both can be directly used with the [Howler](https://howlerjs.com/) API.

Installation
------------

```shell
$ npm install soundfx
```

Usage
-----

```js
const Howler  = require("howler")
const SoundFX = require("soundfx")

const soundfx = new SoundFX()
const about   = soundfx.attrib()

const effect = new Hower({ ...soundfx.config("bling1"), preload: true })
effect.play()

const sprite = new Hower({ ...soundfx.config(), preload: true })
sprite.play("bling1")
```
